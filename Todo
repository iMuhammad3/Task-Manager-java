1. Create a Task Class: Define a Task class that has attributes like a
task name and description.

2. User Interface: Implement a text-based menu system that allows users to:
    • Add a new task.
    • List all tasks.
    • Remove a task.
    • Quit the application.

3. Data Storage: To persist tasks between sessions, you can use a simple
text file or a serialized object to save and load tasks.

4. User Input Handling: Use the Scanner class to capture user input and
execute the corresponding actions based on their choices.

5. Task List: Create a data structure, like an ArrayList, to manage the list of tasks.

6. Task Operations: Implement methods to add, remove, mark tasks as
completed, and display the list of tasks.

7. Error Handling: Handle user input errors gracefully. For example,
if the user enters an invalid option or a task that doesn't exist.

8. Menu Loop: Use a loop to keep the application running until the user decides to quit.
